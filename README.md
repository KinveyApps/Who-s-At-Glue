iBeacon-enabled conference meet-up app for Gluecon

## What the App Does


## Backend Setup 

1. Create a new app on Kinvey
2. Create the following collections:
    * `events` - This collection should have one row to describe the event including the following columns:
         * `Name` - common name, for your use only
         * `interests` - an array of topics covered by the conference
         * `startDate` - the KinveyKit-formatted date & time for the conference to start. e.g. `"ISODate(\"2014-05-01T17:54:00.000Z\")"` .
         * `endDate` the KinveyKit-formatted date & time that the conference ends
         * `boothPopupDistance` - max distance in meters for the "Welcome to Kinvey" popup - tweak to configure the user experience between useful and annoying
         * `portalURL` - the web portal for the app. This is configurable because the URL wasn't known at ship time
    * `roomBeacons` - This collection has a row for each beacon at the conference
         * `event` - the `_id` of the corresponding event in the `events` collection
         * `name` - a short, user-visible string to identify the beacon in the UI
         * `uuid` - the beacon uuid 
         * `major` - the beacon major identifier
         * `minor` - the beacon minor identifier
         * `beaconId` - this field is autogenerated by business logic to create a unique identifier based on the uuid, major, and minor numbers
         
## Business Logic Setup
Upload the business logic scripts to the new app.

1. Download the BL Command Line Interface
2. Navigate to the root of the project directory [http://devcenter.kinvey.com/ios/bl-cli-downloads](http://devcenter.kinvey.com/ios/bl-cli-downloads)
3. Temporarily rename the business-logic directory

        mv business-logic/ business-logic-temp/
 
3. Run and select the newly created backend.

        kinvey init
        
4. Delete the new directory

        rm -rf business-logic
        
5. Move the temp directory back

        mv business-logic-temp/ business-logic/
     
7. Upload the code

## LinkedIn Setup
The app is set up to use LinkedIn login, since there is also an option for creating a new app account with just email and password, it's optional.

Follow these instructions to create a new app with LinkedIn: XXXX

## App Setup

1. Download the source 

        git clone
     
2. Before the app can be used, the dependencies have to be pulled through CocoaPods. If you've never used CocoaPods before, first follow the instalation steps here [http://cocoapods.org/](http://cocoapods.org/). 

3. Since the Podfile is in the repo, just install it:

        pod install
    

4. Open `WhosAtGlue.xcworkspace`
5. In `Appdelegate.m` add the Kinvey app credentials, and the LinkedIn credentials in `-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`.
6. In `EventModel.m` set the `kEventId` macro to be the `_id` of the particular event row in the `events` collection. 
7. In `MainViewController.m`  also insert that event id in the `kEventId` macro, and optionally specify a `kKinveyBoothId` if you want a particular beacon to trigger the Kinvey popup. 

8. Export the `events` and `roomBeacons` collections from the Kinvey web console. Copy the generated `.json` files into the project. These are used to pre-seed the data in case the app started in offline mode.
